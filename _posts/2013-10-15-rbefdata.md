## Title

`rbefdata` - leveraging access to data and semantics

## Abstract

Today ecologists face a deluge of data like in many other disciplines. This
puts much pressure on the development of tools that foster the preservation of
data as well as the exploration and reuse of available data. Many tools and
concepts available in data management provide solutions to different parts of
the data life cycle. However not all of them are widely spread or accepted
throughout ecology. This situation can be improved by the tight integration of
data management concepts into existing and widely used software and thus into
the daily workflow of researchers. Paper proposals and data provenance as ways
to promote the discussion of ideas and collaborations, metadata to improve data
preservation and information exchange as well as the integration of semantic
resources to enhance data exploration and processing. These represent only a
few examples of valuable concepts with the potential to improve the progress of
a data intensive scientific domain like ecology.
